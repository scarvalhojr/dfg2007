(your letter head, date)


To whom it may concern,

this letter is to confirm my willingness and intent to collaborate with
Prof. Jens Stoye on the project "Engineering of Compressed Text Index
Structures" proposed to the Priority Program "Algorithm Engineering" of
the German Research Foundation (DFG) in January 2007. In recent years I
have performed extensive research on efficient algorithms for succinct
and compressed text index structures, and I am interested in
collaborating with Prof. Stoye and his group on the development and
engineering efficient implementations of such methods. I will also be
happy to welcome researchers from Prof. Stoye's group for a cooperation
meeting in Helsinki in fall 2007.

Yours sincerely,
